# CSC Test
[中文文档](./README_CN.md)

---

This is an android app that can detect whether the CSC device works fine or not.

You can use it in your factory to test if the device is functional.

You can use it in your store to test if the devices are fine.

You can use it in your home to see the device is broke or not.

---

Usage:

Just tap the CSC device shown on the listview, it will connect it and receive the CSC data.

If the data changes, it means the device works fine.

If there is nothing shown in the console, it means your device has a problem.

If your device is not showing in the listview, maybe your device has a bluetooth problem, OR maybe you haven't granted the location permission.

FYI:

When you finish testing one device, you have to tap the FINISH button to start over again.

If the app stacks, the RESET button might helps.
